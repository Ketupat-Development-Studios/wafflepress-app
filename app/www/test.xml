				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having marked the chemistry exam scripts <a href="http://waffle.ketupat.me/2015/07/03/ct2-meet-the-marker-part-1/" target="_blank">incredibly quickly</a>, the department has already announced its plans for future common tests. In order to make the exam fairer and more approachable, the department has decided to take a number of important measures.</p>
<p>Firstly, the last five questions on the OMS will automatically be shaded as the option ‘A’, saving students the precious few seconds it takes to fill something into those ovals and whisper a quick prayer (it is thought that the examination hall is the most religious place on earth). This idea emerged after intense statistical analysis revealed that the vast majority of students did not actually make it past question 20. The department was unclear as to whether ‘A’ actually would be an answer to any of the affected questions.</p>
<p>Another important step is a change in the format of Section C. The department has proposed a Neither/Nor option instead of the current Either/Or. The decision is entirely a result of the sheer number of scripts that had circled a question on the cover sheet, but failed to actually attempt it. This move is expected to relieve the burden of selecting a question and of finishing the paper, both of which students have cited as problematic areas for them, together with the rest of chemistry.</p>
<p>Since foolscap paper went largely untouched by most students, the department also has plans to issue graph paper instead. This comes after psychological analysis of the intense demoralising effect it has on candidates who sat stupefied, staring into space throughout the paper. The graph paper is also expected to ease the marking process: the complete lack of space will require students to present all answers graphically and probably incorrectly. An automated marking system involving a mechanised A4-sized red ink stamp is in the works to speed up marking of this section.</p>
<p>Finally, the department plans to shorten the duration of the paper while keeping the total number of marks the same. This comes after several chemistry examiners complained about students (albeit a very small number) completing the entire paper, extending marking times. Chemistry tutor Dr Shu Er Dai believes the cut in time will have a minimal impact on the vast majority of students “who don’t know what they’re doing anyway”. Dr Shu instead expects them to be heartened that the paper is a shorter, and therefore less torturous experience.</p>
<p>The changes are expected to take effect as early as the Y5 Promos this year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Evidently paying little heed to the good science advice doled out by Dr Bingley and Waffle Press, a humanities student appears to have attempted a science experiment that has gone completely wrong.</p>
<p>We caught up with Will Sun, the student in question, at his home. Dressed impeccably in a tweed tailcoat and a felt derby, he agreed to give Waffle Press an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>Will tells us he got interested in science after repeated good-natured jabs by his peers about his scientific ignorance. As soon as he finished denouncing them as philistines, he set about devouring countless scientific texts, taking full advantage of his famed comprehension skills. He was particularly inspired by <i>The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline</i>, which he described as “prophetic”, laying the groundwork for the mysterious <i>thiotimoline</i> to be employed in many more areas due to its ability to dissolve prior to the addition of a solvent.</p>
<p>In the end, what really pushed him to pursue his hidden passion for the sciences was <a href="http://waffle.ketupat.me/2015/07/04/ct2-student-outdoes-all-expectations-in-chemistry-paper/" target="_blank">the story of Jess See</a>, the young chemistry student with a talent in producing very commercially viable products.</p>
<p>In an interview filled with buzzwords and thinly veiled derision, Will explained how his humanities background would propel him further in science than even the finest RA student. While appearing slightly chemically disadvantaged, he commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A multifarious protean pedagogy is the sine qua non de nos jours; it develops a far more chrysostomatic cosmopolite vis-a-vis jejune scientific proletarians. Prima facie, my sesquipedalian mien far transcends the piddling pastiches of those risible mendicants and tyros who suffered much deserved obloquy during the recent plebeian assessment.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Having exhausted the SAT word list, the polymath moved on to show us the experiment in question. It appeared to be a pot containing a small plant, which the student insisted was of the species <i>Hempus Notweedus</i> (a horticulturist we consulted tells us no such plant exists). More astonishing however, was the condition the plant was in. Despite being a few months old, the plant was still very small and appeared gravely ill. Several leaves had been crudely severed and cheap band aids were used to cover the areas where they once were.</p>
<div id="attachment_178" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://waffle.ketupat.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/923796_1445948999062899_1023853693_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178" src="http://waffle.ketupat.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/923796_1445948999062899_1023853693_n-300x300.jpg" alt="a photo of the plant in much better days kindly provided by Will" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">a photo of the plant in much better days kindly provided by Will</p></div>
<p>Will refused to allow us to take the plant to a local horticulturist, telling us proudly that after four hours on WebMD, he had successfully diagnosed the plant with lung cancer (among several other ailments). He proceeded to denounce the horticultural abuse that pervades almost every aspect of today’s society, calling horticulturalists “stooges of the man”. Unfortunately, he was only halfway through his anti-establishmentarian rant when he passed out on the floor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Faced with increasingly restrictive rubrics for SPA grading, school administrators are considering affixing a portrait of the great Dr. Millikan to inspire students in their empirical studies.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will inspire students to get creative if they don’t achieve the prescribed results. In fact, teachers are hoping that the portrait of Dr Millikan will encourage students to take a more pragmatic approach to SPA. After all, if Dr Millikan could win the Nobel Prize with questionable results, surely students can pass their A levels.</p>
<p>Some students and school administrators still expressed concern about the proposal. However, just like anomalous SPA results, the complaints were swiftly ignored.</p>
<p>Discussions are underway to include one of his most famous quotes below the portrait:</p>
<p><i>“If you’re stumped, don’t look down in frustration, look up for intervention and </i><b><i>look left and right for inspiration</i></b><i>.”</i></p>
<p>The department also intends to launch a campaign to encourage students to adopt department endorsed SPA skills. Voting for the campaign slogan is now underway and design submissions are welcome in the comments below.</p>
<p>Slogans being considered include:</p>
<p><i>“Don&#8217;t be shocked, remember your mock”</i></p>
<p><i>“If you want to be the best, don&#8217;t do that test”</i></p>
<p><i>“Doing it is to your detriment, it&#8217;s an optional experiment”</i></p>
<p><i>“If your results are too strange, get them back in the range”</i></p>
<p><i>“Don&#8217;t be a fool, don&#8217;t touch your tools”</i></p>
<p>The most popular slogans will be engraved on every lab bench in the Science Block. Other suggestions by supporters of this measure include printing “guiding answers” on the back of the question papers and removing lab equipment from the lab altogether to rescue any self-righteous students from certain death.</p>
<p>Several students taking subjects that do not lend themselves to Dr. Millikan&#8217;s philosophy as easily as the Sciences have expressed their concern over the unfair inspiration Science candidates may gain during their practicals. However, the release of the CT2 results is expected to quickly end their protests.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To the disbelief of all who have ever been in his presence, the <i>deanses listos</i>, a minor species of <i>snӕk</i> is reportedly going on holiday. With the Common Tests concluding on Friday, this particular <i>snӕk</i> wasted little time engaging in post-paper demoralisation discussion sessions and instead grabbed his luggage and headed off for a vacation.</p>
<p>Of especial interest is his choice of location &#8211; the great Foundations of Shaw. This is understandable: though most sane non-masochists would recognise this place as the polar opposite of a great holiday destination, such behavior is characteristic of <i>snӕks</i>. After obtaining permission to curl up in a remote corner and moult, he promptly buried himself under a mountain of obscure quantum mechanics texts for a five minute nap.</p>
<p>Our valiant reporter ventured closer to the <i>snӕk’s</i> den to question him further, at great risk to life and liberty. As it turned out, the <i>snӕk</i> &nbsp;was influenced by a tutor of his who noted the absolute lack of chance he was giving and suggested he <i>“take 5”</i>.</p>
<p>The inhumane reference had resulted in a great deal of wailing and despair amongst his lesser peers. Unperturbed and largely perplexed by their response, the <i>snӕk</i> then decided upon his current course of action, which he described as “down-payment” for an exemplary teacher’s recommendation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many students have admitted they have had difficulty deciding which day of school to skip this week. While some have opted to extend their weekend by excusing themselves from Monday&#8217;s lessons, others are still deciding how to optimize their unproductive time and minimise their opportunity cost.</p>
<p>This comes after Youth Day was rescheduled, leading several students to look for a compensatory holiday in the vicinity of the 5th of July. Despite the cancellation of the day off, most students are happier with this arrangement as it gives them greater flexibility in deciding when to reimburse themselves. Having enjoyed themselves thoroughly over their first two genuine days of holidays since forever, many are expected to need a few days to adjust back to their short, nasty, brutish existences.</p>
<p>In addition, the realisation that the respective academic departments would not be releasing any results in their entirety this week to prolong students’ distress has aggravated many students. In protest to this, a significant number have decided to indulge themselves and take multiple days or even the rest of the week off.</p>
<p>A poll by the Millikan Foundation has revealed Tuesday and Wednesday as popular choices amongst students. While partially attributed to a need for a break in the middle of the week, the researchers discovered an interesting pattern in the results.</p>
<p>Students of the genus <i>snaek</i> appear of have a strong preference for taking Tuesday off, with many of them citing the large number of non-academic periods as the primary reason. This is expected, considering the <i>snaek</i> often prefers to study by itself and is averse to all uses of time that do not contribute to grades.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the shift in certain lectures to Wednesday has led many more holistic students to opt to skip school on Wednesday. This is, once again, hardly a surprise as school is expected to end well past 3pm.</p>
<p>Several teachers have expressed concern over this kind of planned mass bunking. However, Waffle Press analysts pointed out that the distribution of absentees in the manner described will help mitigate their frustrations as a sufficient number of students will be present to make classes and lectures appear full. A minority of tutors who declined to be named admitted to “hoping more students would succumb&#8221;, allowing them to continue to playing snooker.</p>
<p>It has also been reported that doctors in the Bishan area are seeing several students for a “headache”, “stomachache” and other unverifiable medical conditions. The printing shop has also noted that it has had significantly higher revenues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>This is the fourth and final article in our Meet The Markers Special Report</i></p>
<p>Yesterday, the school administration filed a police report upon realising that no GP tutor had been seen since the GP CT. Having completed their marking in double-quick time, the other academic staff had turned their attention to more important matters including playing ping pong and laughing at students&#8217; scripts only to realize that their marking went unmolested by the vociferous arguments that usually emanate from that particular department. Missing person posters are expected to be up soon as students and staff maintain their vigil in hope of the return of the General Paper tutors.</p>
<p>After several days investigating, our reporters believe that they have found the GP examiners, still intently grading essays, in the jungles of Mongolia. Even 5 weeks after the paper, there appears to be no respite for our brave GP tutors, who have been working endlessly since the end of the paper to power through the long and convoluted essays that students have produced.<br />
Some GP tutors appear to have developed severe asthma, citing this as a crucial factor in their move away from busy, and often hazy, Singapore. One particular tutor noted the profound irony in students beginning their essays with the saying &#8220;There&#8217;s no smoke without a fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discussing the scientific basis of such a claim with the Department of Chemistry was entirely inconclusive as Chemistry tutor Dr Shu was preoccupied with the colour of the smoke. However, her conclusions about the aromatic qualities of the paper fell flat when she declared the scripts “burnt with a sooty flame”.</p>
<p>We spoke to GP tutor Mr Mak Shi Tup, a marker of the Application Question in the paper. Mr Mak was entirely unsurprised to see poor responses in the paper, with some students managing only a few feeble lines on eating culture in Singapore. He found that many responses demonstrated a poor understanding of the passage, allaying fears the GP department had that someone might actually figure out what the author was saying.</p>
<p>Mr Mak also revealed some insights into the actual marking procedure. He told us a bit about the complex thought processes that went behind the indecipherable squiggly, wavy, straight and double lines that often litter papers. When asked about the random number generator open on his laptop however, he was quick to shoo us away.</p>
<p>Once again hit hard by the tragedy were our Semiconductor friends. Due to the strategic placement of the GP exam a day before their final exam, their minds were far too preoccupied with the massacre that was to come to be cognizant of the massacre they were already embroiled in.</p>
<p>This concludes our special report revealing what exactly markers get up to with students’ scripts. Fortunately, students and markers alike will soon get to relive the trauma of the paper come next week. On behalf of the markers we would like to remind students any <del>whining</del> protests about their marks is unlikely to be paid much attention to as “markers are never wrong, reality is simply frequently inaccurate”.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the third article in our Meet The Markers special report.</em></p>
<p>The Economics Department, in contrast was preoccupied with preparing questions for the Prelim examinations later this year. In the few minutes calculated and allocated to us on the basis of the marginalist principle, we managed to glean a few precious nuggets of information about the recent examinations. Microeconomics markers appeared to be particularly envious of Macroeconomics Trade markers given the bulk of students chose to begin from the Micro section and end somewhere before the passing mark. The absurdly limited time allocated to the paper ensured not even the most illegible Arabic scribblings allowed any student to complete the paper with any degree of satisfaction.</p>
<p>As put succinctly by an Economics student, “nobody studies trade”, allowing the Trade markers to complete their marking quickly and efficiently. Some markers complained of running out of ink as a result of the large crosses they had to draw on students’ scripts but these complaints were brushed aside by those assigned to other questions who were trying to find a way to simultaneously draw crosses and bang their heads against the wall.</p>
<p>To find out just how the department managed to wipe the floor with so many students, we spoke to Mr Yew Dun Ngoh, Jack, a prominent teacher at the Department of Economics. Mr Yew once again brought up the strategies employed by the Chemistry department of testing things that students were unlikely to know, thereby trimming marking time significantly.</p>
<p>Most notably, he raised a key strategy involving not teaching HP students anything about International Economics, thereby disqualifying a large chunk of the students who would be able to finish the paper from writing that particular essay. This, he says, had the spillover effect of convincing naive science students that they could get by without studying the topic, a mistake many of them are now kicking themselves over. Noting the more “freeform” teaching style in the HP as well as the focus on “self-learning”, he believes students should have known better.</p>
<p>In an effort to rub salt in their wounds, the Department set a “pure regurgitation” International Trade question, the only kind of question science students are known to do well in. This teased them as they were forced to impale themselves on the spikes of question 4b, giving markers an intense morbid glee in the symbolic spillage of red ink.</p>
<p>As of this writing, the Department of Economics was seen marking the final scripts with mixed feelings &#8211; the joy that the marking was almost over, and the unmistakable horror that this batch might not make it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still reeling from the shocking blow dealt to them by the single semiconductor question in the Physics paper, semiconductor physics students were entirely unamused to discover that the chemistry department had opted to test them on Silicon and Germanium. Our reporters interviewed several students who had embarked on the monumental task of studying semiconductor physics as an optional subject for 6 months.</p>
<p>The students involved were deeply offended and entirely confused when only 1 semiconductor question came up in the Physics paper, making no mention of the space charge region they had come to know and love. Instead, these mathematically inclined physics students were tested on their favourite topic of semiconductors in a lengthy question that appeared in the chemistry paper. But in a cruel twist of fate, the question asked them about irrelevant properties of semiconductors entirely removed from their primary purpose in electrical circuits.</p>
<p>One student said “I’m a physics student, studying periodicity is for bio students”. Another, while echoing his sentiments added “who the heck uses silicon as an acid? It’s a semiconductor”.</p>
<p>The group is also coming under increasing pressure as reports are emerging of the <a href="http://waffle.ketupat.me/2015/07/02/ct2-physics-student-in-ish-set-to-outdo-peers/" target="_blank">controversy over the single semiconductor question in the physics paper</a>. While our young semiconductor engineers argue that the difference in bandgap would result in a resistivity difference of several orders of magnitude, their pleas fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Please extend your support if you see any of these poor students around. Give them a pat on the back and remind them that the MOE H3 students have their exams after A levels.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is the second article in our Meet The Markers special report.</em></p>
<p>After a meeting the Department of Chemistry, we managed to interview<a href="http://waffle.ketupat.me/2015/06/13/rsi-does-intensive-research-on-time-you-wont-believe-what-they-discovered/" target="_blank"> Dr Bingley from the Department of Physics</a> to find out what his department’s marking experience was like. In the precious few minutes before his flight to the Bahamas, our reporters learned that in fact the Physics marking took place during the paper itself.</p>
<p>Dr Bingley mentioned that the questions in the CT2 were significantly more “<a href="http://waffle.ketupat.me/2015/07/02/avengers-now-least-favourite-superheroes-among-students-survey-finds/" target="_blank">interesting</a>” than the previous paper and focussed on testing a few topics in an in depth manner (semiconductor fans may not agree). He felt that this targeted approach was a crucial factor in decisively crushing any student who took the paper as physics students tend to be entirely unaccustomed to studying anything in depth.</p>
<p>After an MCQ section that he described as “doable” he says he was heartened to find that almost no students managed to complete the paper. He attributes this success to the long structured questions asking for qualitative answers, yet another Achilles heel for unsuspecting physics students.</p>
<p>The real kicker though, was the Data Analysis question that almost every student claimed to only understand as the papers were being collected. This, Dr Bingley felt, was what eventually brought even the strongest students to their knees. Dr Bingley claimed the question was especially perplexing in its convoluted attempts to explain how the machine students were to analyse was more efficient under non-ideal conditions, an idea that he claims full credit for.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that after the Data Analysis markers finished marking the proof and the single box in the table, they had to fill the void in their lives by marking the MCQ entirely by hand. This is expected to have a negative effect on student morale as the machine marked MCQ was one of the last sanctuaries for embarrassed physics students to hide their incompetence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A student who has achieved poor grades throughout his life reportedly scored an astonishing 25/20 for the Chemistry CT2 question C2 (OR) (referred to within the department as &#8220;<i>we didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d get this far</i>&#8220;).</p>
<p>The student, Jess See, impressed examiners with deep insights into the production process of all reagents and products with commonly available household equipment. Markers were particularly impressed by her synthesis of a particular chemical compound, known in some circles as &#8220;Blue Sky&#8221;. She further went on to successfully describe all reaction mechanisms with a skill level characteristic of an experienced chemist and seasoned user.</p>
<p>The teacher who set the question, Dr Walt Er, holds a PhD in organic chemistry and crystallography. Despite his strong credentials, he described the achievement as entirely astonishing. He said &#8220;the part that really took the cake was when the student attached a small sample of crystalline organic compounds that displayed exemplary knowledge of the subject matter and a clear mastery of experimental technique&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dr Er is presently looking to engage the student in some &#8220;experimental and research work, just for fun&#8221; outside school, an experience he hopes will allow the student to expand her interests in the area and make significant contributions to the scientific community.</p>
<p>While he chose to keep the nature of the research work a secret, we believe it to be defense-related as the police arrived at Dr Er&#8217;s lab just as our reporter left. We understand both teacher and student will be housed in a secure but undisclosed location surrounded by high walls and armed guards.</p>
